## IT and Automation
- IT is more capable of introducing automation on a large scale.
- Many manufacturing processes have been automated:
	- Robots are widely used in manufacturing for repetitive assembly tasks
- Overall, automation helps us:
	- Increase efficiency and reduce human errors
	- Free humans from dangerous and/or boring tasks

### Automation in Manufacturing

### Generative AI
- With the use of generative AI, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, jobs requiring advanced degrees are also at risk.
- According to a [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ariannajohnson/2023/03/30/which-jobs-will-ai-replace-these-4-industries-will-be-heavily-impacted/?sh=51487d115957), the sectors that are most affected by AI will be:
	1. Finance and banking : AI can monitor transactions and give detailed financial advice.
	2. Media and Marketing : AI can be used to generate contents, for example, media outlets like Business Insider, CNET and CNBC have used ChatGPT to write news stories.
	3. Legal Services : AI chat bots can be used to provide legal services to those who can’t afford services from real lawyers.

Example:
- The story: A metal serving cart belonging to airline Avianca hurt Mr. Roberto Mata’s knee in an August 2019 flight. Mr. Mata sued the airline, but the airline asked the judge to dismiss the lawsuit because the statute of limitations had expired.
- Mr. Mata’s lawyer, Mr. Steven Schwartz, responded with a 10-page brief citing more than half a dozen court decisions.
- It turned out that these cases were not real. They were fake cases generated by ChatGPT.

- People without access to the Internet and other information technologies are at a socio-economic disadvantage, for they are less able to find and apply for jobs, shop and sell online, participate democratically, or research and learn

Digital divide may worsen over time without government intervention.
Digital Divide has 2 dimensions:
1. Global Divide
	- Wealth:
		- Some countries may lack resources to invest in ICT infrastructure. People may not have enough money to acquire the devices used to connect to the Internet.

## Affirmative Action
- Some of these policies incorporate elements of affirmative action, which is also known as _positive discrimination_.

Arguments against Affirmative Action:
1. Reverse Discrimination
	- Affirmative action can result in reverse discrimination, where individuals from historically advantaged groups may face disadvantages.
2. Contradicting merit-based selection
	- Affirmative action undermines the principle of meritocracy.
3. Perpetuation of stereotypes
	- Individuals who are selected under affirmative action may face doubts about their own abilities and skepticism from others. This can reinforce stereotypes and perpetuate the notion that individuals from certain minority groups need special assistance to succeed.
4. Not addressing the root cause
	- Affirmative action addresses the symptoms of inequality rather than the root causes.

Arguments supporting Affirmative Action:
1. Breaking the vicious cycle
	- Persistent lack of representation can lead to a vicious cycle:
	- ![[Pasted image 20240731051045.png]]
	- Affirmative action can help break this vicious cycle.
2. Compensatory justice
	- Supporters also argue that affirmative action is a form of compensatory justice, aiming to rectify past and ongoing injustices.

### Affirmative Action in Different Countries
- Different countries have different approaches and legal frameworks regarding affirmative action.
- Examples:
	- In New Zealand, affirmative action is provided for in Human Rights Act 1993 and the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Individuals of Maori or other Polynesian descent are often easier access to university courses and scholarships.
	- Singapore has so far avoided affirmation action in the workplace.

# Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP)

- Incentives for firms to promote gender balance:
	- Increasing pressure from investors to demonstrate corporate social responsibility (CSR)
		- Pressure varies from country to country
	- Diversity may increase revenue

# "Winner-Take-All"
In economics, a winner-take-all market is a market in which a product or service that is favored over the competitors, even if only slightly, receives a disproportionately large share of the revenues for that class of products or services.

- Common in IT Industry. Examples:
	- Microsoft Office (Globally)
	- Amazon (US)
	- WhatsApp (many countries)

Can make it hard for smaller players to compete or survive.
