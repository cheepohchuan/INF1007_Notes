# Balance between privacy and safety
- Most people are willing to give up some privacy for public safety.
- The right balance depends on people's attitude towards privacy, which is affected by:
	- Recent events (i.e 9/11 Attacks)
	- Culture

## Culture

| Individualistic Culture    | Collectivist Culture            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Personal-emphasized        | Social-emphasized               |
| Views people as unique     | Views people as part of a group |
| Encourages self-expression | Discourages self-expression     |
| Emphasizes competitiveness | Emphasizes group harmony        |
- Singapore is a collectivist society
- Important Notes:
	- Individuals within a society can have varying degrees of emphasis on privacy
	- Societies can exhibit a mix of individualistic and collectivist tendencies, and the importance placed on privacy can vary within different contexts.


# Fighting Covid
- Culture played a significant role in how governments have managed the pandemic
- Collectivist societies, such as Singapore and Taiwan, have more success in controlling the spread of the virus than countries with individualistic cultures, such as the US and the UK.

# Personal Data Collected by Governments
## Public Records
- Birth Cert
- National ID cards
- Marriage Cert
- Motor vehicle records
- Criminal records
- Deeds to property
- HR records of public employees
- Tax returns
- Education and qualifications
- Health data
- Immigration and travel data
- Social benefits and welfare data
- Census data

## Debate on National Identification Cards
- Facilitates integration of personal data from different sources
- Allow the appropriate governmental authorities to monitor the movement and transactions of every registered citizen.
	- Help deter terrorism and other related societal crimes through pre-screening and tracking of citizens.
- Concerns:
	- Potential privacy rights violations
	- Cost associated with establishing and maintaining national ID card system
- Countries without national ID Cards:
	- Australia
	- New Zealand
	- UK
- Alternative ID's:
	- Birth Cert, passports, driver's licenses, Social Security Cards, Etc

# Mass surveillance
Mass surveillance is the intricate surveillance of an entire or a substantial fraction of a population in order to monitor that group of citizens

## Mass Surveillance Technologies
1. Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV)
	- CCTV systems consist of cameras that capture video footage in specific locations. In Singapore, there are over 100,000 surveillance cameras.
2. Facial Recognition
	- Facial recognition analyzes and identifies individuals based on their facial features. It compares captured images or video frames with a database of known faces to identify or verify people.  
	- Facial recognition technologies that enable real-time image and video processing can help in sieving through closed-circuit television camera footage.
3. GPS Tracking
	- Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking enables real-time location monitoring by utilizing satellite-based positioning systems. It is commonly used in vehicle tracking or personal tracking devices.  
	- Example: The Ugandan government recently announced that GPS trackers would be placed on every vehicle in the country.
4. Drones
	- Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones equipped with cameras are utilized for aerial surveillance. They can provide a comprehensive view from above, making them valuable for various applications such as border control or crowd monitoring.
5. Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)
	- ANPR systems use optical character recognition and image processing techniques to capture and analyze license plate numbers. They are frequently used for law enforcement, parking enforcement, and toll collection.
6. Internet and Social Media Monitoring
	- With the proliferation of online communication, surveillance includes monitoring Internet activities, social media platforms, and digital content to track individuals, identify trends, or detect potential threats.
7. Communication Interception and Monitoring
	- Technologies for intercepting and monitoring communication include wiretapping, packet sniffing, and lawful interception systems. These tools enable the collection of voice, text, or data communications for surveillance purposes.
8. Data Integration
	- Surveillance systems often integrate data from multiple sources, such as video feeds, sensor networks, social media, and public databases. Data integration techniques combine these disparate data points to generate comprehensive profiles of individuals.
9. Data Mining
	- Surveillance often involves processing vast amounts of data to identify patterns, anomalies, or specific events. Machine learning, data mining, and other analytical techniques are employed to extract meaningful information from surveillance data.

# Cryptography
- By encrypting communications and data, individuals can prevent surveillance entities from accessing the content of their messages and files.
- Even if intercepted, encrypted data appears as meaningless gibberish without the decryption key.

- After the war, the US made it illegal to sell or distribute encryption technology overseas.
- Many restrictions have been relaxed due to increased commercial demand for encryption technologies
- Regulations related to cryptography depend on jusrisdiction:
	- __Encryption Export Controls__: Some countries have regulations prevent the proliferation of strong encryption technology to unauthorized entities or countries of concern.
	- __Key Escrow and Access Requirements__: Some jurisdictions require individuals or organizations to retain cryptographic keys or provide access to encrypted information to authorized entities, such as law enforcement or national security agencies.

## FBI-Apple Encryption Dispute
- Background:
	- 2 individuals carried out a terrorist attack on Dec 2015
	- Resulting in multiple casualties
	- FBI obtained an iPhone used by one of the shooters.
- FBI requested Apple to unlock the device by creating a backdoor, but Apple refused to comply and argued that creating a backdoor would compromise the security and privacy of its products.
- The dispute escalated into a legal battle: The FBI obtained a court order to compel Apple to assist in unlocking the iPhone, but Apple challenged the order.
- Before the court ruling, FBI unlocked the phone with the assistance of a third-party vendor.

# Debate on Mass Surveillance
## Support for Mass Surveillance
- "We must be willing to give up some privacy if it makes us more secure"
- "If you've got nothing to hide, you shouldn't worry about government surveillance"
	- Counter arguments:
		- Privacy
			- Some consider privacy as a fundamental human right. Even law-abiding citizens value privacy as it fosters freedom of thought and expression and promotes innovation.
		- Potential Abuse
			- Granting surveillance powers without adequate checks and balances increases the risk of abuse. Even if one trusts the current authorities, there is no guarantee that future governments or officials will use surveillance capabilities responsibly.
		- Errors and False Positives
			- Surveillance systems are not infallible and can produce false positives or errors. Such errors can lead to unwarranted invasions of privacy, damage to reputations, and disruption of individuals' lives.
	- Examples:
		- Brandon Mayfield Example
			- Background:
				- On March 11, 2004, ten bombs exploded on four commuter trains in Madrid, Spain, killing 191 people and wounding more than 2,000 others.
				- The Spanish government retrieved a partial fingerprint from a bag of detonators, and the FBI linked the fingerprint to Brandon Mayfield, an attorney in Portland, Oregon.
			- What Happened:
				- FBI agents secretly entered Mayfield’s home multiple times, making copies of documents and computer hard drives, collecting ten DNA samples, removing six cigarette butts for DNA analysis, and taking 355 digital photographs.
				- On May 6, 2004, the FBI arrested Mayfield as a material witness and detained him for two weeks.
				- The Spanish government later announced that it had matched the fingerprints to an Algerian national living in Spain.
				- A judge ordered that Mayfield be released.
				- The FBI publicly apologized for the fingerprint misidentification and paid Mayfield $2 million.

“Why should an innocent man be investigated?”
- Jerry Berman is the founder of the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) in the US.
- He argues that a better question to ask is “Why should the government investigate me when I have done nothing wrong?”
