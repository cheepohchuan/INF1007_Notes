	- Outcome:
		- Ended prematurely due to extreme behaviours demonstrated
			- Guards became increasingly abusive and brutal
			- 2 Prisoners showed symptoms of distress or mental breakdown
	- Interpretation:
		- Behavioural differences between guards and prisoners driven by situational and social factors
		- Participants may have been acting according to the stereotyped views of how guards and prisoners behaved or according to how they thought the experimenter wanted them to behave

# Moral Licensing

# Cognitive Biases
- A ___Systematic___ pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgement

## 4 Cognitive Biases
- Cognitive dissonance
- Confirmation bias
- Conformity bias
- Fundamental attribution error and self-serving bias

# Cognitive Dissonance
- Mental discomfort people feel when their beliefs and actions are inconsistent and contradictory
- Motivates individuals to reduce the inconsistency and restore cognitive harmony by changing either their beliefs or actions.

## Typical defence mechanisms against cognitive dissonance
1. Changing the behaviour
2. Changing the unwelcome cognition
3. Avoiding or denying unwelcome cognition
4. Explain away the unwelcome thoughts by _rationalization_

# Confirmation Bias
- Tendency to search for and interpret information in a way that confirms one's prior beliefs
- This bias makes us select information that support our views, ignore contradictory information, or interpret ambiguous information as supporting our views.

Other factors contributing to confirmation bias:
- __Social influence__: surrounded by like-minded individuals, no opposing views
- __Bounded rationality__: our brain's limited capacity in processing alternative hypothesis

# Conformity Bias
- Tendency to take cues for proper behaviour from the actions of others rather than exercise our own independent judgement.
- Asch conformity experiment:
	- In presence of confederates making consistent wrong answers: 35.7% error rate.
	- Absence of confederates, 0.7% error rate.

- May motivate people to act altruistically
	- Donating to charity, when others are doing it
- May lead us to commit acts against our own values to gain social acceptance

# Fundamental Attribution Error
- Tendency to attribute other people's actions to their character or personality rather than situational factors outside of their control.
- The fundamental attribution error exists because of the limited information we have on the situational factors that others are facing.

## Self-serving bias
- Tendency to attribute their successes to internal factors while attributing their failures to external factors beyond their control.
	- Attribute unethical actions to external factors
	- Judging different people using different standards.


# Education and Awareness
- None of us are immune to cognitive biases
- Education and awareness help us make more objective and rational decisions.
