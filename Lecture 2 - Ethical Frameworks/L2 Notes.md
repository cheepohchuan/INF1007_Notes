# Ethics
- Focuses on people's voluntary, moral choices
- Ethics: rational, systematic analysis
	- Conclusions should be supported by explanations based on facts, shared values, logic

Workable ethical theory: Produces explanations that is persuasive to a skeptical, yet open-minded audience

# Subjective Relativism
- ### Relativism
	- No universal standards of right and wrong
	- 2 person can have differing view and both be correct
- ### Subjective Relativism
	- Each person decides right and wrong for him/herself

Conclusion: Not a workable ethical theory

# Cultural Relativism
- "Right" and "Wrong" depends upon a society's moral guidelines
- These guidelines vary from place to place and time to time
- A particular action may be right in one society at one time and wrong in another society or at another time

| Cultural Relativism<br>For                                  | <br>Against                                                                                                                                              |

Conclusion: Not a workable ethical theory

# Divine Command Theory
- __Good Actions__: Those aligned with God's will
- __Bad Actions__: Those contrary to God's will
- Holy books reveal God's will
- Use holy books as moral decision-making guides

| Divine Command Theory<br>For    | <br>Against                                                    |

| God is all-good and all-knowing | Society is increasingly multicultural and secular              |
| God is the ultimate authority   | Different holy books disagree on certain teachings             |
| We owe obedience to our creator | Some modern moral problems not directly addressed in scripture |
|                                 | Based on Obedience, not reason                                 |
Conclusion: Not a workable ethical theory

# Ethical Egoism
- Each person should focus exclusively on his or her self-interest
- An action that provides the person with maximum long-term benefit is the morally right action; otherwise, it is morally wrong

| Ethical Egoism<br>For                                                                                                    | <br>Against                   |

| Better to let other people take care of themselves                                                                       |                               |
| Community can benefit when individuals put their well-being first, <br>in line with __Laissez-faire economic theories__. |                               |
Conclusion: Not a workable ethical theory

# Kantianism
- Moral Principles can be derived from pure reason
- An action is performed in accordance with some principle. The moral worth of the action is judged by this underlying principle.
## Categorical Imperative
- Central to the Kantian philosophy
- A Categorical Imperative denotes an absolute, unconditional requirement that must be obeyed in all circumstances.
- A Hypothetical Imperative applies to someone who wishes to attain certain ends.

## 1st Formulation: Universality
"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law"

Example:
__Maxim/Principle behind action__: "I will borrow money without the intention to return"
__If Principle is universalized__: No one will lend money anymore as no one will return the money. So, I would not be able to borrow money in the first place.

The universalization of this principle leads to a contradiction.
Therefore, an action based on this principle violates the categorical imperative and it is unethical.

## 2nd Formulation: Humanity
"Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.”

Example: 
__Action__: "Purchases a report and submits it as her own work"
__Apply 2nd formulation__: Attempting to deceive the Prof, treating the Prof as a means to an end
	- End: passing the course
	- Means: Manipulate Prof
Conclusion: Wrong to turn in a purchased report.

| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hold everyone to the same standard  | Sometimes no rule adequately characterizes an action.<br><br>Example: Stealing food for starving children<br>   ▪“It is permissible to steal”<br>   ▪“People should care for their own children.”<br>   ▪“It is permissible to steal to help children in need.” |
| Produces universal moral guidelines | Sometimes difficult to resolve conflicting underlying principles                                                                                                                                                                                                |
Conclusion: Despite weaknesses, a workable ethical theory

## Consequentialism
- Holds that consequences of one's conduct are the ultimate basis for judgement about the rightness or wrongness of that conduct.
- Frameworks:
	- [[#Utilitarianism]]
## Deontology
- Normative ethical theory that the morality of an action should be based on whether that action itself is right or wrong under a series of rules and principles, rather than based on the consequences of the action
- Frameworks:
	- [[#Divine Command Theory]]
	- [[#Kantianism]]
# Utilitarianism
Act Utilitarianism: Applies principle of utility to individual actions
Rule Utilitarianism: Applies principle of utility to moral rules
## Utility
- Proposed by English philosophers *Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill*
- An Action is good if benefits exceeds its harms, vice versa
- Utility: A measure of happiness
	- Happiness = Advantage = Benefit/Good/Pleasure
	- Unhappiness = Disadvantage = Cost/Evil/Pain

## Principle of Utility (Greatest Happiness Principle)
- An Action is right (or wrong) to the extent that it increases (or decreases) the total happiness of the affected parties.

## Act Utilitarianism
- Sum the change in happiness of all beings by the action
	- Happiness: Positive Number
	- Unhappiness: Negative Number
- Sum > 0 : Action is Good
- Sum < 0 : Action is Bad
- Right action to take : One that maximizes the sum

Example:
Building New Highway

| Benefits                                                              | Cost                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $39 million savings in driving cost<br><br><br><br>Total: $39 Million | $20 million homeowner compensation<br>$10 million highway construction<br>$1 million lost of wildlife habitat<br><br>Total: $31 Million |
Conclusion: Benefit > Cost : Building the new highway is a Good Action.

### Problems with Act Utilitarianism
- Too much work
- Cannot predict all outcomes
- Susceptible to moral luck
	- Example: Sending flowers to hospitalized Aunt, but she suffers an allergic reaction.
## Rule Utilitarianism
Applying Principle of Utility to Rules
- Adopt moral rules which will lead to the greatest increase in total happiness

Example:
__Action__: "Sending flowers to hospitalized Aunt"
__Rule__: "Send flowers to people in hospital"
__Analysis__: "In general, sending flowers to people in hospital can bring happiness to these people. In Comparison, the cost of flowers is relatively low"
__Conclusion__: "The action of sending flowers to my hospitalized aunt is good"

| Utilitarianism<br>For                      | <br>Against                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Practical                                  | Not all consequences can be measured or quantified             |
| Appeals to a wide cross-section of society | Utilitarianism ignores fairness in the distribution of utility |
Conclusion: Despite weaknesses, both act and rule Utilitarianism are workable ethical theories

# Social Contract Theory
- Social Contract is the explicit or implicit agreement between individuals who willing give up certain rights in order to enjoy the benefits of society.
	- Example:
		- Humans give up the right to yell as lout as they want whenever they want
		- In return for the comforts of a respectful, ordered society
- To ensure justice in society, when someone breaches this contract, he/she will suffer negative consequences.
	- Example: If you break the law, you may end up in jail

Contributors:
- Past
	- Thomas Hobbes - 1651
	- John Locke - 1689
	- Jean-Jacques Rousseau - 1762
- Recently
	- John Rawl's work revived interest in Social Contract Theory

### John Rawl's Principles of Justice as Fairness
- 1st Principle: Each person has the same indefeasible claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal basis liberties, which scheme is compatible with the same scheme of liberties for all;
- 2nd Principle: Social and economic inequalities are to satisfy 2 conditions:
	- 1. They are to be attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity;
	- 2. They are to be the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members of society (Difference Principle)
		- Example: Progressive Income Tax:
			  Doesn't treat every citizen equally
			  But justified since greatest benefit to the most disadvantaged.

| Social Contract Theory<br>For                                                                                                                          | <br>Against                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Explains why rational people do not normally behave in a socially unacceptable manner, even when such behavior is not explicitly prohibited by the law | No one signed social contract |
| •Explains why it is okay for government to deprive criminals of certain rights                                                                         |                               |
Conclusion: Despite weaknesses, a workable theory

# Virtue Ethics
- A virtue is a disposition that leads to morally good actions. 
- A vice is a disposition that leads to morally bad actions.

[[#Kantianism]], [[#Utilitarianism]], [[#Social Contract Theory]] ignore important moral considerations
- Moral Wisdom
- Moral Education
- Role of Emotions

## Virtues
Virtues allow human beings to flourish and be truly happy.
2 types of virtues:
1. __Intellectual Virtues__: Values associated with reasoning and truth
2. __Moral Virtues__: Virtues of character (e.g. Honesty)
	- Developed by habitually performing right action
	- Disposition to act in a certain way and feel in a certain way

What is a morally right action:
A right action is an action that a virtuous person would do in the same circumstances.

How to be virtuous:
- No one is born virtuous
- Learn from role models. Practice repeatedly.

## Moral Guidance from Virtue Ethics
- For a given ethical problem,
	- Identify the relevant virtues
	- The right action is the one that is consistent with these virtues
		- "What would a person with these virtues do?"
	- Also consider the circumstances of the situation

Example:
Manager considering to hire a candidate with necessary skills, but a history of lying on his CV.
Analysis:
Virtues: Honesty, Integrity and Prudence.
	Commitment to Honesty and Integrity:
		Do Not Hire
	Prudence:
		Consider the impact of your Decision
After considering all relevant factors: Decide not to hire.

| With  this theory, there are no irresolvable moral dilemmas because the virtuous person always knows what is the right thing to do |                                                                           |
