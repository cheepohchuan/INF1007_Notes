# Privacy
Definition:  Privacy is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively.

- Privacy encompasses the right to keep certain aspects of one's life private and to have _*Control*_ over the _collection_, _use_, and _dissemination_ of personal data or information.

Example:
- “She is a hypocrite. Obviously, she enjoys being in the spotlight.”
- Plain Logic:
	- Statement is logically flawed.
		- By definition of privacy, there is no contradiction between her living a high-profile lifestyle and complaining about the violation of her privacy.
- Social Contract Theory:
	- Statement is NOT logically flawed.
		- Society generally accepts the trade-off between fame and privacy. By living a high-profile lifestyle, she implicitly agrees to this trade-off.

## Benefits of Privacy
- Promotes creativity
- Improves psychological health
- Prevents harm from "bad people"
- Fosters true friendship
- The right to live a normal life

1984 (Book) highlights the importance of privacy in safeguarding personal autonomy, human dignity, and the ability to protect oneself from the abuse of power.

## Consumer Backlash
